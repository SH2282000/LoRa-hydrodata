# LoRa-hydrodata
This project is client-server and LoRa based. The data of multiple sensors is sent in 433MHz to the master in order to make it available online.


##Communication 
In order to communicate, all the clients are sending their data to a centralized server which transfer all this data over the internet to the user device.

###The network modulation
LoRa is a **low-power wide-area network modulation technique**. It is based on spread spectrum modulation techniques derived from chirp spread spectrum technology. It was **developed in Grenoble**, France.

###The range
As we use 433MHz frequency with a power of emmission of 10mW (legal limit in France), the range should be located between **2 and 8 km** depending on the terrain.

##Sensors
The sensor are waterproof themal sensor used to mesurate the different temperatures of pool all across a park.
